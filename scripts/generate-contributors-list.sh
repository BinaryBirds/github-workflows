# Contributors List Generator
#
# This script generates a CONTRIBUTORS.txt file based on the git commit history.
# It uses `git shortlog` to collect contributor names and email addresses and
# formats them into a human-readable list.
#
# The generated file is intended to be:
# - Deterministic
# - Automatically maintained
# - Not edited by hand
#
# Intended usage:
# - CI or release tooling to keep CONTRIBUTORS.txt up to date
# - Local usage before publishing or tagging a release

# All output is written to stderr for consistent CI and local logs
